authotkey run as administrator context menu
===========================================
Adds a context menu item for autohotkey scripts allowing you to run them as administrator.

There's two versions; one for if your autohotkey is installed in Program Files, and another if it is installed in Program Files (x86).

The uninstall file works for both.

To use them, simply double click them to apply them to the registry.
